// AJAX : Asynchronous JavaScript And XML

// AJAX is not a programming language.
// AJAX just uses a combination of:
// A browser built-in XMLHttpRequest object (to request data from a web server)
// JavaScript and HTML DOM (to display or use the data)
// AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common to transport data as plain text or JSON text.

// JSON : JavaScript Object Notation

// JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
// JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.
// JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format.
// JSON is language independent *
// JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand
// JSON uses JavaScript syntax, but the JSON format is text only.

// 1. Response (JSON)
// 2. convert to JS Object

// json() method : returns a promise that resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.
// (Input is json string, Output is JS Object)
